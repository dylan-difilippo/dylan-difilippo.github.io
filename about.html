        <center><p1>Hello! My name is Dylan DiFilippo, and I am a Computer Science Major at the University of Rhode Island. I attended <a href="https://www.bishopfeehan.com/">Bishop Feehan High School</a> in Attleboro, Massachusetts for high school, where I enrolled in my first programming course during my senior year.</p1></center><br><br>
        <center><p1>I enjoy spending time with my friends, playing video games, and learning more about the world of programming. I am from Pawtucket, Rhode Island, where I have lived my whole life with my parents and our miniature poodle, Sunshine. I met my girlfriend, Elizabeth, in high school. She is an Animation Major at <a href="http://www.sva.edu/">the School of Visual Arts</a> in New York City.</p1></center>
